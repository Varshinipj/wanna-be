## Project Details
ðŸ‘— This project is based on building a content-based Fashion Recommendation
System.

ðŸ‘— Building a recommendation system needs two datasets - the training and the
mapping dataset. The training dataset is the DeepFashion dataset (which is
available only for non-commercial purposes). The mapping dataset is created
using Webscraping using BeautifulSoup in Python.

ðŸ‘— Scraping : https://www.kaggle.com/code/varshinipj/scraping-data-and-images-from-a-shopping-site

ðŸ‘— Training dataset: Category and Attribute prediction benchmark dataset from DeepFashion

ðŸ‘— Mapping dataset: A local database created by scraping images and pricing data from various black-owned small businesses.

ðŸ‘— Model used for attribute prediction: FastAI - attribute prediction stage 1 ResNet34 

ðŸ‘— Evaluation metric: FBeta score

ðŸ‘— Loss Function: Label Smoothing BCE with Logits Loss Function

ðŸ‘— Color Prediction:  using KMeans algorithm

ðŸ‘— The scores for attributes and color are stored in a dataframe, whenever a picture is uploaded onto the recommender, the image/product with the highest score will
be recommended first.

ðŸ‘— The UI is built using Streamlit.

ðŸ‘— Working final product: https://github.com/Varshinipj/wanna-be/blob/main/streamlit-app-2022-06-06-02-06-16.mp4
